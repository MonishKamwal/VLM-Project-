<H3>Summary</H3>

The research was conducted to lay the foundation for a Vision Language Model to perform Image and Language Analysis on Breast Cancer X-Ray images and Radiology Reports respectively. The model is aimed to identify breast cancer and generate human-readable reports for enhanced diagnotics and practical applications. In addition to this, a handy guide to operate the Centre for Analytics, Informatics and Research (CAIR) system at Memorial University of Newfoundland was also created. 

<H3>Description</H3>

- **Initiated and Co-Developed a New Project**: Collaborated with two graduate students to lay the groundwork for a Vision Language Model (VLM) designed to analyze breast cancer images and associated radiology reports.  
- **Designed Advanced Analytical Tools**: Researched and experimented with multiple models, including custom Vision-Language Models (VLMs) built from open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Computer Vision Models (CVMs).  
- **Dataset Exploration**: Conducted extensive research to identify and curate datasets suitable for breast cancer image and report analysis, ensuring robust data for model development.  
- **Critical Research and Documentation**: Reviewed a wide range of research articles and papers to inform model design and implementation, compiling a comprehensive reference library to streamline future work.  
- **System and Knowledge Transfer**: Authored a simplified manual for operating high-performance computing systems at VAC Lab, ensuring accessibility for researchers with varying technical expertise.  
- **Prepared Succession-Oriented Deliverables**: Developed a clear and concise project report detailing model experiments, challenges, alternate approaches, and recommendations, enabling seamless continuation by subsequent research teams.  
- **Focus on Explainability**: Contributed to designing the VLM to not only identify breast cancer but also generate human-readable reports explaining the model's decisions, enhancing interpretability and practical application in medical diagnostics.
